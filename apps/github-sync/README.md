# github-sync

Keeps GitHub issues and Poietic Issues in step, both ways ([ADR 0029](../../docs/adr/0029-github-sync-through-the-bridge.md)).

- **GitHub → tracker:** GitHub issue and comment webhooks arrive through [Poietic Bridge](https://bridge.poietic.tech).
  The sync follows every `github` terminal it can read, through one subscription per terminal (`issues-sync`).
- **Tracker → GitHub:** it polls the tracker's event log and writes through the GitHub REST API.
- **Repositories ↔ projects:** a repository belongs to the project that lists it under _repos_; one project can
  hold several. A repository with no project gets a new private one named after it.

| GitHub                             | Tracker                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| title, body                        | title, description                                         |
| open                               | any backlog/unstarted/started status (reopen → first open) |
| closed as completed                | first completed status                                     |
| closed as not planned / duplicate  | first canceled status                                      |
| labels (by name)                   | labels (by name, created when missing)                     |
| comments (with "@login on GitHub") | comments (with "Name in Poietic Issues")                   |
| issue deleted                      | issue trashed                                              |
| closed as not planned              | issue trashed                                              |

A tracker issue reaches GitHub when its `repo` is set, or its project has exactly one repo. Assignees, priority,
estimates and other tracker-only fields stay in the tracker.

Logs are one JSON object per line. Events that fail for good (a validation error, say) are logged as
`bridge.event_skipped` / `tracker.event_skipped` and passed over; network and server failures are retried and
never skipped.

## Identity and access

The sync acts as its own agent, `github-sync`, and needs:

1. the agent and its token: `poietic-tech agents create github-sync` (or auth.poietic.tech/account/agents);
2. membership of the `bridge-admins` group at auth.poietic.tech/admin, so it can read every terminal (a terminal's
   readers cannot be changed after it is created);
3. the tracker **admin** role, because it creates projects. The agent appears in the tracker on its first request
   (start the sync once, or run `POIETIC_AGENT_TOKEN=pat_… poietic-tech issues whoami`); then, as an admin,
   `poietic-tech issues user edit github-sync --role admin` (add `--reactivate` if it is pending);
4. a fine-grained GitHub token, resource owner `poietic-tech`, with **Issues: read and write** (and the default
   Metadata: read) on the repositories to sync.

Deployment on the local K3s cluster is in [deploy/k3s/README.md](../../deploy/k3s/README.md).
