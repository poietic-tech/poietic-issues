# Deployment

The tracker ships as **one process**: the HTTP API, the web app and the webhook worker. It runs on Postgres (SQLite also works for a single small instance) with attachments on local disk or any S3-compatible store.

## Quick start with Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` runs the production shape: tracker, Postgres 16 and SeaweedFS for S3 storage.

```sh
docker compose up -d --build --wait poietic-issues
docker compose exec poietic-issues poietic-issues db bootstrap --handle you --name "Your Name"
```

`bootstrap` creates the first admin and prints an API token. Open http://localhost:3000, paste it into **API token** and sign in. Everything else, such as projects, users and more tokens, is managed from there or with the CLI:

```sh
export POIETIC_ISSUES_SERVER=http://localhost:3000 POIETIC_ISSUES_TOKEN=trk_…
poietic-issues project create -k ENG --name Engineering
poietic-issues user create --handle claude --name Claude --kind agent
poietic-issues token create --user claude --name ci      # token for an agent
```

The compose file is a starting point, not a hardened production setup: it uses fixed passwords and plain HTTP. Put TLS in front of it (see [Reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy)) and change the credentials.

## The image

`docker build -t tracker .` produces a Node 22 slim image. It contains:

- `dist/server.mjs` and `dist/poietic-issues.mjs`: single-file bundles made by `pnpm build` ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-packaging.md)).
- `web/`: the built SPA.
- The native SQLite driver.

The image runs as the `node` user, keeps state in `/data` (a volume), listens on port 3000, and has a `HEALTHCHECK` on `/readyz`. The `poietic-issues` CLI is on the `PATH`, so admin tasks run with `docker exec … tracker …` in local mode against the same database.

Its defaults:

| Setting                       | Value                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`                    | `production`              |
| `POIETIC_ISSUES_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:/data/tracker.db` |
| `POIETIC_ISSUES_BLOB_DIR`     | `/data/blobs`             |
| `POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTO_MIGRATE` | `1`                       |

Point `POIETIC_ISSUES_DATABASE_URL` at Postgres for anything beyond a single small instance.

Without Docker: `pnpm install && pnpm build`, then run `node dist/server.mjs` with `POIETIC_ISSUES_WEB_DIR=apps/web/build`. The bundles need only `better-sqlite3` from `node_modules`.

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables, validated at startup. An invalid value stops the process with a list of the problems. Defaults depend on `NODE_ENV`: development defaults (left) favour convenience, production defaults (right) favour safety.

## Database and migrations

- **Postgres 14+** is the production database. The server needs a normal user that owns its schema. Timestamps are `timestamptz`, and all times are UTC.
- **Migrations** are files compiled into the bundle. They run at startup when `POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTO_MIGRATE=1`. Kysely's migrator takes a lock, so replicas starting together are safe.
- **Explicit migrations.** To run migrations as a separate release step instead, set `POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTO_MIGRATE=0` and run `poietic-issues db migrate` with `POIETIC_ISSUES_DATABASE_URL` set, e.g. `docker run --rm -e POIETIC_ISSUES_DATABASE_URL=… tracker poietic-issues db migrate`.
- **Status.** `poietic-issues db status` shows applied and pending migrations.
- **Back up before upgrading.** Once a release's migrations have run, older releases that migrate at startup (`POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTO_MIGRATE=1`, the image default) cannot start on that database: the migrator stops with `corrupted migrations: previously executed migration <name> is missing`. With `POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTO_MIGRATE=0` an older release does start, against a schema it doesn't know; that is unsupported. Take a backup (below) before deploying a release that adds a migration, and check that it opens with `poietic-issues db status --database <url-of-the-copy>`.
- **Rolling back.** Prefer fixing forward. To run the previous release again, its database must not have the newer migrations. Either restore the pre-upgrade backup, losing every write since, or revert the schema in place:
  1. Stop the server.
  2. With the **new** release's CLI, run `poietic-issues db migrate --down` once per migration to undo. Each run reverts the newest applied migration; older releases don't know the migration, so they can't revert it. It never reverts the first migration, and it refuses a SQLite path with no database file. Check with `poietic-issues db status`: the reverted migrations are listed under `Pending`.
  3. Start the previous release.

  Reverting drops whatever the migration added. Reverting 0004 drops project visibility, memberships, linked repos and issues' repo links; migrating forward again re-runs its backfill (every project private, every active non-admin an editor).

- **Upgrading to project visibility (migration 0004).** Existing projects stay `private`, and every active user who is not an admin or the `system` user becomes an `editor` of every existing project, so nobody loses access. Admins need no membership. Users and agents created afterwards start with none: add them to a project to give them access. So do users who are deactivated when the migration runs, including SSO sign-ins still waiting for approval: after an admin activates them, they see only public projects until someone adds them to a project. Projects set to `public` are readable without signing in; see [security.md](security.md#project-access). The backfill is stamped with the time the migration runs.
- **Upgrading to short SSO sessions (migration 0006).** Every session of a user with an SSO identity is deleted once, so sessions from before ADR 0025 cannot outlive a sign-out at the issuer. Those users are signed back in from the sign-in page, silently while they are still signed in to the issuer. A token or dev login of an SSO user ends too. Users without an SSO identity keep their sessions.
- **SQLite** works for single-instance installs. It runs in WAL mode with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` writes, so the server and CLI can share the file. Put it on a local disk, not network storage.

**Backups** need the database (e.g. `pg_dump`) and the blob store: the bucket, or `/data/blobs`. Restore both from the same point in time. An attachment row whose bytes are missing downloads as 404; bytes without a row are only wasted space.

## Health, logs and shutdown

- **Health probes:**
  - `GET /healthz` is liveness (the process is serving).
  - `GET /readyz` is readiness: it checks the database, and returns `503` once shutdown has begun.
- **Logs** are JSON lines on stdout in production. There is one `request` entry per API call, with `reqId`, `method`, `path`, `status`, `ms` and `actor`. `reqId` matches the `X-Request-Id` response header and the `requestId` in problem responses.
- **Shutdown.** On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` the server:
  1. stops accepting connections and fails readiness;
  2. ends live event streams with a `shutdown` event, so browsers reconnect elsewhere and resume with `Last-Event-ID`;
  3. waits up to `POIETIC_ISSUES_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` for in-flight requests;
  4. stops the webhook worker and the event tailer, and closes the database.

  Webhook deliveries in flight when a process dies are retried by any replica once their 60-second lease expires.

## Scaling out

Several replicas can run against one Postgres database:

- **Live events.** Every replica tails the event log and is woken by `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, so live updates reach clients on any replica.
- **Webhooks.** Every replica with `POIETIC_ISSUES_WEBHOOKS=1` may deliver. Fan-out and claiming are serialized, so each delivery is sent once per attempt.
- **Attachments** must use S3 (or shared storage).
- **Sessions** live in the database, so no sticky sessions are needed.

## Single sign-on

Set `POIETIC_ISSUES_SSO_ISSUER` and the related configuration variables to enable SSO. See [ADR 0018](adr/0018-sso-via-shared-cookie-jwt.md) for the design.

New users signed in via SSO start deactivated (the sign-in answers with the `PENDING_APPROVAL` error code) until an admin approves them, unless their SSO role matches `POIETIC_ISSUES_SSO_ADMIN_ROLE` (default `admin`) or they are in the group named by `POIETIC_ISSUES_SSO_MEMBER_GROUP` (issues.poietic.tech uses `issues-users`). Both are checked only when a user is first created: someone who signed in before joining the group stays pending until approved, and leaving the group later changes nothing ([ADR 0026](adr/0026-sso-member-group.md)). To list and approve pending users:

```sh
poietic-issues user list --include-deactivated  # find pending users

The route returns `503 UNAVAILABLE` when the issuer's JWKS (signing keys) cannot be fetched.

## Reverse proxy

Terminate TLS in front of the server and set `POIETIC_ISSUES_SECURE_COOKIES=1` (the production default). Live updates use Server-Sent Events on `/api/v1/events/stream`, and **the proxy must not buffer them**:

```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://tracker:3000;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  client_max_body_size 30m;          # ≥ POIETIC_ISSUES_MAX_UPLOAD_MB
}
location /api/v1/events/stream {
  proxy_pass http://tracker:3000;
  proxy_buffering off;               # the server also sends X-Accel-Buffering: no
  proxy_read_timeout 1h;             # heartbeats are sent every 15 s
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Connection '';
}
```

If the web app is served from a different origin than the API, add that origin to `POIETIC_ISSUES_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

Notes:

- Behind a TLS-terminating proxy, `POIETIC_ISSUES_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must include the public origin (for example `https://issues.example.com`), or `POST /auth/sso` answers 403 (CSRF protection).
- The handle of a pending user is derived from the name in the token. Confirm it with the person before approving.
- Signing out lands on `/login?signedout=1`, which skips the automatic SSO attempt so the user is not signed straight back in; they can press the SSO button to sign in again.

## Cloudflare Containers (issues.poietic.tech)

The production instance runs on Cloudflare Containers. See [ADR 0019](adr/0019-cloudflare-containers-with-litestream.md) for the design.

**Layout:** `deploy/cloudflare/` holds the Worker (`src/worker.ts`), container configuration (`src/container-env.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `Dockerfile`), and Litestream setup (`litestream.yml`, `entrypoint.sh`). Requests flow: browser → Worker (`poietic-issues`) at https://issues.poietic.tech → container on `:3000`. The route is owned by OpenTofu in poietic-tech/poietic-dot-tech.

**Data:** The database is SQLite at `/data/tracker.db` inside the container, replicated by Litestream 0.5 to the R2 bucket `poietic-issues-db`. Attachments are stored in R2 bucket `poietic-issues-attachments` via the S3 API. The container sleeps after 30 minutes without requests (`sleepAfter = '30m'`; an open live-update stream counts as activity, including an anonymous one on a public project, so a browser tab or script left on `/api/v1/events/stream` keeps the container awake), and Litestream syncs on the way down.

**Restore:** The entrypoint restores only when `/data/tracker.db` is absent, which means a fresh container disk (every cold start, since Containers have no persistent disk). On the very first boot, when the bucket holds no replica, it starts a new, empty database and the tracker migrates it. Restore fails closed: if the replica cannot be read (wrong credentials, R2 unreachable, missing bucket), Litestream exits non-zero before the tracker starts, so the container never serves an empty database in place of the real one. `deploy/cloudflare/test/restore.sh` covers both. To recover, fix the cause and let the next start restore; delete nothing.

**Backups:** The replica is not a backup. Litestream's retention prunes old history, and the R2 bucket has no object versioning, so a bad write or a deleted bucket is not recoverable from it alone. Take periodic independent copies, for example locally, with the R2 credentials exported as `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`:

```sh
litestream restore -o tracker-$(date +%F).db \
  "s3://poietic-issues-db/tracker?endpoint=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com&region=auto&forcePathStyle=true"
```

Store the file somewhere other than R2. Copy the attachments bucket at the same time.

**Upgrades and rollback:** The image migrates at startup (`POIETIC_ISSUES_AUTO_MIGRATE=1`), so a deploy that adds a migration changes the live database as soon as the new container starts. From then on the previous image cannot start: the tracker exits with `corrupted migrations: previously executed migration … is missing`, and the container restarts in a loop. Redeploying the previous image alone does not help, because every cold start restores the migrated database from the replica.

- **Before merging a release with a migration**, take a snapshot with the backup recipe above, named for the release (e.g. `tracker-pre-0004.db`), and check it with `poietic-issues db status --database sqlite:tracker-pre-0004.db`.
- **Fix forward** if the release misbehaves. This is the default: push a fix to `main`, and the schema stays as it is.
- **Go back to the previous release** only if fixing forward is not possible. The container restores whatever the replica holds, so publish a database without the migration as a new replica first:
  1. Choose the database. Either take the current data (`litestream restore -o tracker-now.db "s3://poietic-issues-db/tracker?…"`, the same URL as the backup recipe) and revert the migration with the new release's CLI, from a checkout of it: `pnpm poietic-issues db migrate --down --database sqlite:tracker-now.db`. This keeps the writes, but drops what the migration added. Or use the pre-deploy snapshot, which loses every write since the deploy.
  2. Replicate the file once to an empty bucket with the same R2 credential: `litestream replicate -once tracker-now.db "s3://<new-bucket>/tracker?endpoint=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com&region=auto&forcePathStyle=true"`. Keep the path `tracker`: the container's `litestream.yml` restores from it. Then check the result, because this step decides what the container serves: restore it with `litestream restore -o check.db …` (same URL) and run `poietic-issues db status --database sqlite:check.db`. The reverted migration must be listed under `Pending`, and the data must be there (e.g. `poietic-issues issue list -P <KEY> --database sqlite:check.db`). An empty or wrong bucket boots an **empty tracker**, since a reachable empty replica counts as a first boot. The bucket and the credential's access to it are managed in poietic-tech/poietic-dot-tech.
  3. On `main`, revert the release and point `DB_BUCKET` in `wrangler.jsonc` at the new bucket in the same commit. The deploy workflow ships it, and the fresh container restores from the new bucket.

  The old bucket is left untouched, so this can be undone. The backup recipe above names `poietic-issues-db`; after a rollback, use the new bucket in it. These steps were checked with Litestream 0.5.17 against an S3-compatible store (revert, replicate once, restore, and the previous release reading the result). Writes made between step 1 and the deploy are lost, so keep that window short. Never delete or overwrite the live replica in place, because the running container keeps replicating to it.

**Deploys:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs after CI passes on a push to `main`. It can also be started by hand (`workflow_dispatch` on `main`); that is the owner's escape hatch and deploys `main` as it is, without waiting for CI. The workflow is the only deploy path: the deploy package has no `deploy` script, because a manual `wrangler deploy` without `--var R2_ENDPOINT:…` breaks every request. It requires these secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token with **Workers Scripts Write** and **Workers Containers Write**. It needs no R2 permission.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Cloudflare account ID.
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the separate R2 S3 credential used by Litestream and attachments (minted by poietic-dot-tech's infra/api scripts for this repository, poietic-tech/poietic-issues).

The workflow sets the R2 credentials as Worker secrets, deploys, and smoke-checks `/readyz` for up to about 10 minutes (a cold start includes the restore).

**Environment changes:** The new Worker goes live before the container rollout replaces the image, so for a short window the old image can run with the new Worker's environment. Any change to the container's environment contract (`deploy/cloudflare/src/container-env.ts`) must therefore work with both the previous and the new image for one deploy. For example, send both the old and the new variable names for a release, then drop the old ones. See [ADR 0019](adr/0019-cloudflare-containers-with-litestream.md#consequences) for the 2026-10-08 incident.

**Admin:** There is no `docker exec` on a remote container. Use the CLI in remote mode:

```sh
export POIETIC_ISSUES_SERVER=https://issues.poietic.tech POIETIC_ISSUES_TOKEN=<admin-token>
poietic-issues user list
poietic-issues user edit <handle> --reactivate   # approve pending SSO users
```

**Local test:** `deploy/cloudflare/test/restore.sh` builds the container image and uses SeaweedFS to simulate S3 storage, proving on `linux/amd64` that data survives a container replacement and that a fresh container with an unreachable replica (wrong secret key, closed endpoint) exits without serving.
